Internet Computing Assignment 3 

1) So Inside the main folder you will find 3 folders namely : 'Part1', 'Part2', 'Part3'.
2) Each Part consists of Source files and XML, XSD and DTD files respectively.
3) In Part 1, it contains different classes which explains the inheritance, method overriding, method overloading etc concepts. In this just run the 'Hospital.java' file so that you will be able to see the desired output.
4) In Part 2, it has a 'JunitTesting.java' named file. This file has the main logical code to find out the square root, count A's in a string, divide methods. And the test cases for these methods have been placed in respective test class files like divideTest.java, squareTest.java, countATest.java, which are Junit files. The file named 'all.java' is a JUnitSuite File which is used to run all the above mentioned test case files.
5) In Part 3, it has 2 folders. In the Folder 'Validation_Against_XSD', it contains an XML File, an XSD File and a Validator java class file. You can run the Validator java class File so that it validates the XML and XSD documents and displays the output. If the flag becomes true thenm the XML document got validated against the XSD Document.
Similarly in the Folder 'Validation_Against_DTD', it contains an XML, DTD and validator file. You can run the Validator java class File so that it validates the XML and DTD documents. The flag comes as true if the XML Document is validated against the DTD Document.

Thank you. :)
